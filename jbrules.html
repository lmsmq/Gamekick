<h1>GameKick Jailbreak Rules</h1>

  <p>[G2] Please attempt to solve any disputes between two parties politely before contacting admins</p>

  <p>[CT22] Warden must give T's a repeat if asked</p>

  <p>[T3] Ts cannot !lr on wardays</p>
  <p>[T4] If a T is following a CT into warday they can be killed</p>
