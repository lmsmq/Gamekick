<h1>NewAge Jailbreak Rules</h1>

  <p>[G1] If there is an issue regarding a rule, highest admin's discretion is enforced</p>
  <p>[G2] Please attempt to solve any disputes between two parties politely before contacting admins</p>
  <p>[G3] If you are unsure on any rules it is highly recommended to join T and get a feel for the game before joining CT</p>
  <p>[G4] No harassment</p>
  <p>[G5] No mic, text, or radio spam</p>
  <p>[G6] No talking over the Warden</p>
